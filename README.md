Design Rationale
Problem Overview
The primary challenge addressed by this program was creating a comprehensive, user-friendly fitness tracking system that allows individuals to record, monitor, and manage their workout activities efficiently. The goal was to develop a solution that could accommodate the following requirements:

Register users and track their personal data (e.g., weight, height, BMI).
Record workouts by specifying body parts, equipment used, and exercise details.
Maintain a history of workout records that users can view later.
Allow users to expand the catalog of muscle parts and equipment as needed.
Step-by-Step Problem Breakdown and Solution Design
1. User Management
Why: Fitness tracking requires associating records with individual users for personalization.
How:
Designed a UserProfile class to handle user data like name, weight, height, and BMI.
Incorporated functions for registering users and dynamically assigning unique user IDs.
Allowed updates to user records, ensuring data integrity over time.
2. Workout Recording
Why: The core functionality of the program is to let users record their workout sessions in detail, minimizing redundant input.
How:
Used a WorkoutTracker class to store workout details such as date, muscle group, sets, reps, and equipment used.
Developed an intuitive process for users to select trained muscles and associated equipment.
Remembering Previous Equipment:
The program tracks and recalls the equipment that users have previously used for specific muscle groups.
When recording a workout, users are presented with a list of relevant equipment theyâ€™ve used before, reducing the need to re-enter equipment details every session.
This not only improves efficiency but also enhances the user experience by minimizing repetitive tasks.
Integrated input validation (e.g., date format, numeric values) to prevent errors during data entry.
3. Equipment and Muscle Management
Why: Not all users will use the same equipment or train the same muscle groups. The system needed to adapt to individual preferences.
How:
Created a Bodypart class to manage hierarchical relationships between muscle groups and their sub-parts.
Designed functions to allow users to add new muscle parts or equipment dynamically.
Ensured compatibility between equipment and targeted muscles by linking equipment to specific body parts.
4. Record Viewing
Why: Tracking progress is crucial for motivation and improvement in fitness routines.
How:
Implemented a method to retrieve past workout records based on the date, allowing users to reflect on their training history.
Progress Comparison:
Added functionality for users to compare their progress over two specific dates.
Users can input two dates and select a specific muscle group.
The program calculates the total weight lifted for that muscle group on both dates by summing the product of reps and weights for all recorded sets.
Compares the total weight lifted to determine whether progress has been made and displays the results to the user.
Displayed the records in a structured format for clarity and ease of interpretation.
Addressing Barriers and Design Decisions
Balancing Simplicity and Flexibility

Challenge: Striking a balance between ease of use and the flexibility to handle complex fitness routines.
Solution: Modularized the code by breaking down each functionality into specific classes and functions. This approach allowed for scalability while keeping the user interface simple.
Reducing Redundancy

Challenge: Avoiding repetitive tasks for users, especially when entering equipment details.
Solution: Incorporated a mechanism to remember and suggest previously used equipment, saving time and effort.
Ensuring Input Validation

Challenge: Preventing invalid data from causing runtime errors.
Solution: Integrated input validation for user-provided data (e.g., numeric values for weights and reps, date formats).
Maintaining User Engagement

Challenge: Avoid overwhelming users with too many choices or processes.
Solution: Designed an interactive menu system with clearly defined options, allowing users to easily navigate the program.
Why This Design Works
This design was chosen to ensure modularity, extensibility, and user-friendliness:

Modularity: The program is divided into distinct components (e.g., user registration, workout tracking, equipment management), making it easy to update or extend specific features without affecting the rest of the system.
Extensibility: Users can add new equipment or muscle parts as their fitness routines evolve, ensuring the system remains relevant to their needs.
Progress Tracking: By providing detailed comparisons of progress over time, the program fosters motivation and engagement.
Reduced Redundancy: By remembering previously used equipment, the program enhances efficiency and minimizes user frustration.
User-Friendly Interface: The program uses an intuitive menu-driven system, supported by detailed prompts and error handling, ensuring accessibility for users with minimal technical expertise.
Ultimately, this program was designed with a focus on providing a functional and engaging tool for fitness tracking, emphasizing adaptability and usability. While improvements can always be made, the current implementation addresses the key requirements effectively and lays a strong foundation for future enhancements.
